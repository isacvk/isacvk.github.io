        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Countless room booking services already exist in the market like Airbnb, makemytrip. This resort was also offering their service in these
          sites. For them one of the main problems was they offered trucking services but had no option to promote or let their clients know that they
          had these services.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>Problems</h4>
        <p>
          In that area a lot of resorts are there, and all of them are on sites like makemytrip or goibibo so standing out in the competition is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          This resort also had trucking services and there was no option to promote or let the clients know about their other service on these
          websites.

      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>Market Research</h4>
        <p>
          Since similar services already exist in the market I did a research on those services and took note of really helpful features and also
          features I wanted as a customer. I did this mainly to find out their most significant pain points, so we bypass them on our way to creating
          a design.

        <h4>Research findings and Personas</h4>
        <p>
          During my research I realized that I found it annoying to login or create an account just to see if a room is available on a specific date.

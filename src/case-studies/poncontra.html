      <p>A website redesign for an agency. My role in this project was as an UI designer.<br />Status : Going live on New Year</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Their previous website was made out of a template. The template was decent but not really tailor made to showcase and convey the message
          they wanted to convey.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
          One of the problems that I found was they delivered a lot of different services like graphics designs, software development and marketing
          but all the services were listed in the navigation section under a dropdown menu. Which was confusing, because usually people expect the
          navigation bar to take them to somewhere but instead it was just a clickable list item which won’t take the user to anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since they were using a template the website wasn’t tailor made to solve their problem. It was definitely a good template but lacked some
          personalization. They wanted to create a modern looking website, because they wanted to attract new startups as their clients.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          So I started thinking about who their potential clients are. They were mainly focusing on startups. They wanted work more with startups. So
          I did some research about the type of design that we wanted develop and finally decided to create a website using 3D models and
          glassmorphism to convey a modern minimalistic website.
        </p>
        <p>
          A website is not just about looking pretty, the website should convey trust and authority as well. I don’t mean a good looking website is
          not a necessity, we all know that a good design creates good opinion about the product without users consciously thinking about it. But to
          establish trust we need prove that we can do the task. So I suggested adding a case studies section, so that potential clients can see their
          work. Currently it’s not in the site because they wanted to launch the site ASAP, but it is something we are planning to add in future.
        </p>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Design and prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          Since this was a redesign of a landing page I did not create personas or wireframe. I directly jumped into Figma and started on the
          designing part. Obviously I went to Pinterest for inspiration. Designing is actually one of my favorite thing in the entire process, so I
          tend to focus a little more on this part.
        </p>
        <p>
          One problem I noticed in the site was listing all their services in a navbar, so to avoid that and keep navbar to do its purpose, I created
          a dedicated section to display all the services they were offering.
        </p>
        <video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="pn-services-video">
          <source src="../res/PC-Services.mp4" type="video/webm" />
        </video>
        <p>
          To make the landing page a little more interesting I created this animation in Adobe After Effects. I’m not an expert in After Effects, but
          my freelance experience in creating some promo videos and intros in After Effects helped me create this simple animation.
        </p>
        <video loop="true" autoplay="true">
          <source src="../res/PC-Hero-Anim_VP9.webm" type="video/webm" />
        </video>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This design is being developed by the PonContra team and they are planning to launch the site on new year. Once the site is deployed I’ll
          update the link to the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway this project was really interesting to do. I had never done glassmorphism for a client before and making those animations in After
          Effects was really interesting. Overall this was a really fun project to be a part of and I really enjoyed the entire process.

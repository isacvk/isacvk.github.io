      <p>
        KK resort is a resort in Coorg, Karnataka. In this project I helped them create a seamless booking experience. <br>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          There are a lot of room booking services already exist in the market like goibibo, makemytrip. This resort was also offering their service
          in these sites. For them one of the main problem was they offered trucking services but had no option to promote or let their clients know
          that they had these service.
        </p>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This resort also had trucking services and there was no option to promote or let the clients know about their other service on these
            websites.
          </li>
          <li>Standing out in the competition was hard as there were a lot of resorts, and all of them were on sites like makemytrip or goibibo.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Market Research</h2>
        <p>
          Since similar services already exist in the market I did a research on those services and took note of really helpful features and also
          features I wanted as a customer. I did this mainly to find out the most significant pain points for users, so we bypass them on our way to
          creating a design. I mainly explored Makemytrip, Goibibo and Airbnb. Even though these services offered much more complex services than
          booking room, I got a really good understanding about which direction to take in this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also got a chance to look at the admin dashboard of goibibo and I took a lot of inspiration from that when designing the dashboard for
          this project.

        <h2>Research findings and Personas</h2>
        <p>
          During my research I realized that I found it annoying to login or create an account just to see if a room is available on a specific date
          on some sites.

        <h2>Low fidelity wireframe and user flow</h2>
        <p>Then I created a low fidelity mockup to make sure my client and their clients are happy with the flow.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          This was my first ever client work and I don’t wanna throw in a bunch of user flows and wireframes and pretend like “look, how professional
          I was from the beginning”. Because I didn’t even know what all of these were at the time of doing this work. I was a total noob. All I knew
          was how to use Figma. And I was also doing backend work with node js in which I was also a noob.
        </p>
        <p>At this stage I was not aware of any design process but all I had was a little common sense.I had to work with that minimal resources.</p>
        <p>Even though I did not create any of these, I did create a user flow in my mind. But I did not know it was called a user flow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Before reaching out to us (My friends were involved in this work), they were using old manual method which is keeping records in a book for
          keeping track of the payments. This method had two major flaws.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sometimes the agents would collect the money but won’t give it to the admins. The clients had no way of ensuring if the money they paid
            got to the admins.
          </li>
          <li>And for admins there was no way to know if the clients paid the money and agents did not give it to them.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          To solve his problem I proposed a messaging system. When the client pays the money to the agent the client will immediately get a message
          notification and the data gets recorded in the database. This ensures the client that the money is collected. This also helps the admins to
          know how much money an agent has collected at any point of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The admins were able to add agents and agents can add clients. I also created a dashboard for users so that they can login to their account
          and check their transactions. The login id and password was sent to the clients at the time of joining the scheme.
        </p>

        <h2>Designs</h2>
        <p>
          These are few of the pages of the final website. But most of the pages are similar because as you can see I used the same elements in all
          pages mainly to reduce the development time. So that me and my team can learn the technologies needed to develop the website and hand over
          the project on time.
        </p>
        <img class="case-image" src="/DH-Desktop-Designs.e7ffecd5.png" alt="userflow">
        <p>
          The designs aren’t my best work but it does what it is supposed to do and the clients were really happy. They actually said the interface is
          very simple and easy to use. And it solved the major problems for them.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
          This project surprisingly went amazing for my first ever client work. The website did solve their primary problems which are mentioned above
          and I implemented some more features like automatic excel sheet generation of the eligible clients and a super admin role to monitor all
          admins, agents and clients.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This was quite a journey, I went through a lot of different mental states in just two months. Designing the UI was my first challenge and I
          somehow was able to finish that within two weeks. But the backend, oh man I struggled a lot. And just the day before handovering the site I
          was installing MongoDB in VPS and I was having issues and just then the stack overflow site went down. Any noobs like me can understand the
          pain and I had to postpone the delivery.
        </p>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>
          I learned a lot. Honestly it has changed me as a person. Mainly because I did not know how to develop the backend. But it sure made me learn
          a lot more things in just two months. I probably learned a lot more than my entire three years of college to be honest. I became a lot more
          interested in the UI/UX field and it sure made me a better person.
        </p>
        <p>Ooh that was a heart touching story, wasn't it? No? Okay then, maybe you could read the next case study.</p>

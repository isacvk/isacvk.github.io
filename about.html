      <h1>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h4>Welcome to story time with Isac!</h4>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          I was born in the little village of Karnataka, Inida. At the time, the village had no electricity supply. I was in primary school when we
          got an electricity connection, and my dad bought a laptop when I was in high school. It was a Lenovo B560 and all I did in that laptop was
          play Need For Speed. I didn't know what else to do because no one in my family knew how to use a laptop, nor did we have an Internet
          connection.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>How it all started</h4>
        <p>
          When I finished my high school, my neighbour, also my uncle bought a WiFi. And that's when the creative journey began. I decided to learn
          photoshop during this time of vacation. I go to his house, download a bunch of photoshop tutorials, go back home and practice. My entire
          vacation went like this and within a year I learned nearly all the important tools and techniques of photoshop.

        <h4>Imposter syndrome</h4>
        <p>
          I was able to redesign just about any design, but when it came to designing my own things, I didn't know what to do. I thought I wasn't
          creative and that's why I can't develop my own designs. And it took me 3 years to figure out that creativity is something I can develop as I
          practise more and more.

      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>College. Why?</h4>
        <p>
          By the time I realized this I was in college doing my BCA graduation. Time flies ha ha. This was such an awesome and wonderful period in my
          life, I hated going to college. Would you like to know why? Because I paid so much less to Udemy to learn much more than I ever learned at
          college. Udemy was my go place to learn new skills, along with YouTube, obviously.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>The passion towards art</h4>
        <p>
          This was the time I started learning music production, I started with video editing, I fell in love with good storytelling and mainly UI/UX.
          As I was familiar with Photoshop, it was quite easy for me to learn Figma. I would say that it just came naturally to me, I was designing
          things in Figma in no time. I really got interested in the field and started learning about it on YouTube. I buy courses on Udemy only if I
          feel like I want to keep learning in this area.

        <h4>First client</h4>
        <p>
          At that time I had an opportunity to work with a client and I didn't want to miss that opportunity. It was a full stack web application and
          I was responsible of the UI and back-end. I wasn't very good at both, but I took the risk anyway and Oh My God, it was way more stressful
          than I thought. I would probably say it was the most stressful time in my life. But I learned a lot about the overall software development
          process. I truly think the risk was worth it. This gave confidence to undertake more demanding tasks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-section">
        <h4>Happy ending</h4>
        <p>
          And now I'm here. So happy that I finally got out of college, and looking to take on even more challenging tasks and have a positive impact
          on people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope my “history” wasn't so boring. And yes, I only included the good parts and there are a lot more things that happened, but you don't
          want to read a biography, do you? I believe that's it for the time being, bye.
